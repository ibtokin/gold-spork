A Django REST interface for Fat-Tony

This interface will be a one-stop shop for all of Fat-Tony's feed and notification data. Since Fat-Tony is only the beginning, I'm going to save my future self a lot of work here by having the server handle all the CRUD operations for the database containing the current feed items. A Python script will interact with the Twitter, Facebook, Instagram APIs and update the database according to our needs. A Django form will be provided to administrators for input as well (push notifications eventually, but let's not get ahead of ourselves as I'm a team of one.)

Don't laugh.
